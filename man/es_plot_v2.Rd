\title{Visualize Effect Sizes with Confidence Intervals in Polar Plot Halves
Effect Size Plot - Version 2}
\arguments{
\item{effect_size}{Numeric, the estimated effect size.}

\item{ci_lower}{Numeric. The lower bound of the 95\% confidence interval. Must be less than \code{ci_upper}.}

\item{ci_upper}{Numeric. The upper bound of the 95\% confidence interval. Must be greater than \code{ci_lower}.}

\item{palette}{Character. The color palette to use for the confidence range. Options are:
\itemize{
\item \code{"viridis"}: A perceptually uniform colormap.
\item \code{"magma"}: A colormap suitable for perceptual uniformity.
\item \code{"plasma"}: A high-contrast colormap.
\item \code{"cividis"}: A colormap optimized for colorblind users.
\item \code{"grey"}: A greyscale palette.
\item \code{"RdYlGn"}: A diverging palette from red to green.
Default is \code{"grey"}.
}}

\item{arrow_color}{Character. The color of the arrow representing the effect size. Default is "black".}

\item{save_path}{Character. Path to save the plot as an image. If \code{NULL} (default), the plot is not saved.}

\item{axis_title_size}{Numeric. Font size for the axis title. Default is 12.}

\item{axis_label_size}{Numeric. Font size for the axis labels. Default is 10.}

\item{reverse}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, reverses the color scale. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{limit}{Numeric. Specifies the range for capping the effect size plot on each end.
For logarithmic scales, this represents the maximum value after log-transformation. Default is 1.}

\item{eff_type}{Character. Specifies the scale of the effect size:
\itemize{
\item \code{"linear"}: Effect sizes are interpreted directly.
\item \code{"log"}: Effect sizes are log-transformed (e.g., odds ratios, hazard ratios).
Default is \code{"linear"}.
}}

\item{num_labels}{Numeric (1, 2, or 3). Specifies the number of axis labels to display. Default is 1.}

\item{area_arc}{Numeric. Specifies the proportion of the CI fan to display.
\itemize{
\item \code{0}: Displays a full circular fan.
\item Values closer to 1 produce narrower arcs.
Must be within the range \verb{[0, 1)}. Default is \code{0}.
}}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot2} object representing the effect size plot with confidence intervals. The plot
can be further customized or saved using \code{ggplot2} functions.
}
\description{
This function creates a polar plot half showing an arrow representing an effect size
and a colored fan representing the 95\% confidence interval (CI). The plot supports both linear and logarithmic effect
sizes, allowing visualization of metrics such as odds ratios, hazard ratios, or standardized effect sizes.
A smooth color transition across the CI enhances interpretability, and the plot provides a clear visual
summary of the effect size and its uncertainty.
}
\details{
Shading in Version 2
How it works: In v2, the shading varies based on the distance from the effect size (estimate):
The shading is darker near the effect size, representing higher certainty around the estimate.
The shading becomes lighter as you move further away from the effect size within the CI range.
Why this is useful: This method emphasizes the most likely region of the CI (near the estimate), while visually de-emphasizing areas near the CI boundaries.
When to choose v2:
If you want to focus attention on the precision of the estimate.
For a more informative and intuitive visualization of the CI's relationship to the effect size.
